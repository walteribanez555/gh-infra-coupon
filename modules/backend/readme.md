# Backend Module

This module provisions a serverless backend API using AWS API Gateway v2 and AWS Lambda. It is designed to expose a comprehensive set of REST endpoints for authentication, user management, coupon and campaign operations, influencer management, and health checks.

## Features
- Deploys an HTTP API Gateway with CORS enabled.
- Integrates a single Lambda function to handle all API routes.
- Configures multiple API Gateway routes for:
  - Authentication (register, login, refresh, JWT creation/verification)
  - User CRUD operations
  - Role CRUD operations
  - Influencer CRUD operations
  - Coupon CRUD operations
  - Campaign CRUD operations
  - Health and metrics endpoints
- Sets up Lambda permissions for API Gateway invocation.
- Manages CloudWatch log groups for API and Lambda.

## Endpoints
- `/api/v1/auth/*` (register, login, refresh, JWT, verify)
- `/api/user`, `/api/user/{id}` (CRUD)
- `/api/roles`, `/api/roles/{id}` (CRUD)
- `/api/v1/influencer`, `/api/v1/influencer/{id}` (CRUD)
- `/api/v1/coupon`, `/api/v1/coupon/{id}` (CRUD)
- `/api/v1/campaign`, `/api/v1/campaign/{id}` (CRUD)
- `/health`, `/health/db`, `/health/metrics`
