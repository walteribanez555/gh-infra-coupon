# Infra-Coupon Project

This repository contains the Terraform configuration for the Infra-Coupon project, which provisions a complete infrastructure for a coupon application, including backend and frontend modules.

## Structure
- **modules/backend**: Serverless API backend using AWS Lambda and API Gateway, exposing endpoints for authentication, user, coupon, campaign, influencer, and health checks.
- **modules/frontend**: Static frontend hosting using AWS S3 and CloudFront, with secure access, CORS, and SPA routing support.
- **main.tf**: Root configuration to orchestrate module deployments and manage shared resources.
- **provider.tf**: AWS provider configuration.

## Features
- Modular infrastructure for separation of concerns.
- Secure, scalable, and performant backend and frontend deployments.
- Automated resource tagging and logging.
- Best practices for access control and error handling.

## Usage
1. Configure your AWS credentials in provider.tf.
2. Run `terraform init` to initialize the workspace.
3. Run `terraform plan` to preview changes.
4. Run `terraform apply` to provision the infrastructure.
